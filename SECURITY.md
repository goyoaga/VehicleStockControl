# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a portfolio project and, as such, does not have a formal versioning schedule. The only version actively supported is the latest code available in the `main` branch.

| Branch | Supported          |
| :--- | :---:              |
| `main` | :white_check_mark: |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I would greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

**Please do not create a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report the vulnerability privately through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature (available on the "Security" tab of this repository).

I will do my best to review your report promptly, confirm the issue, and apply a patch.
